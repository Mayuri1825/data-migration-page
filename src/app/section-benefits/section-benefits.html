    <h2 class="sub-title">Key Best Practices</h2>
    <div class="accordion">
      <details class="accordion-item">
        <summary>Create and Follow a Migration Plan</summary>
        <p>Prepare a concrete plan for what data needs migration, where it will go, and how to get it there. It should also set parameters for access permissions, outline each step, and consider potential downtime and technical issues. Data integrity and protection should feature prominently.</p>
      </details>
      <details class="accordion-item">
        <summary>Build Strong, Allied Teams</summary>
        <p>Knowledge resources to understand the existing system are critical. Access to these experts during planning and testing ensures a complete understanding of the data and processes. Business SMEs who use the data will be critical to sign off on the migrated assets.</p>
      </details>
      <details class="accordion-item">
        <summary>Choose the Correct Accelerators</summary>
        <p>Selecting the right tool sets can significantly reduce migration cost, timelines, and complexity. It enables a systematic, streamlined, and repeatable approach that helps reduce manual errors and increase the overall quality of migrated data.</p>
      </details>
      <details class="accordion-item">
        <summary>Test & Validate Migrated Data</summary>
        <p>After migration, ensure everything is where it should be. Part of testing is creating an automatic retention policy to prevent data leakage. Clean up stale data, double-check permissions, and back up old legacy systems for data access if the new system goes offline.</p>
      </details>
      <details class="accordion-item">
        <summary>Foster Communication</summary>
        <p>Data migration involves many teams: users, new system providers, old system experts, and project managers. Encourage communication and sharing of issues to create a central repository for data quality, improving visibility and avoiding a silo mentality.</p>
      </details>
      <details class="accordion-item">
        <summary>Drive Adoption</summary>
        <p>You need people to agree to turn off the old systems. Identify these key individuals and bring them along on the journey. Decide what documents they will sign off on and ensure these are easy to comprehend.</p>
      </details>
      <details class="accordion-item">
        <summary>Audit and Document Processes</summary>
        <p>Your compliance team will appreciate complete documentation. Depending on your industry, regulators may require proof of adequate care for sensitive data. Auditing the process ensures correctness and helps define the scope for improvement.</p>

      <h3>What Exactly Is a Runbook?</h3>
      <p>A runbook is a detailed guide that lays out the steps, procedures, and contingencies for a process. In data migration, it’s the go-to resource that ensures everyone knows what’s happening at every phase. It covers everything from pre-migration tasks to go-live procedures and post-migration validation.</p>
      <p><em>Think of it like a manual for a complex machine—you wouldn’t try to assemble it without instructions, right?</em></p>
      <h3>Building the Perfect Runbook</h3>
      <p>A good runbook needs to be comprehensive, covering every possible scenario, including the "what-ifs" and worst-case situations. At the same time, it must be clear and simple, accessible to everyone from technical experts to project managers. You can't just plan for things to go smoothly—you’ve got to be ready for the unexpected.</p>
